# Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Roadmap

Welcome! This project is designed as a **reproducible, step-by-step learning path** to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Whether you're a beginner or brushing up skills, follow this plan to build solid understanding and problem-solving ability.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Choose your programming language**  
   Implement all code and solve problems in a single language for consistency (e.g., Python, Java, C++).

2. **Follow the folder structure**  
   Each folder contains:
   - Core data structure implementations.
   - Practice problems using that data structure.
   - Notes and explanations.

3. **Learn progressively**  
   Start with the basics and move toward advanced topics.

## Step-by-Step Learning Plan

### 1. Arrays
- Implement basic array operations.
- Solve easy array problems like Two Sum, Move Zeroes, Maximum Subarray.
- Practice sliding window and two-pointer problems.

### 2. Linked Lists
- Implement singly and doubly linked lists.
- Solve problems such as Reverse Linked List, Detect Cycle, Merge Sorted Lists.

### 3. Stacks and Queues
- Implement stack and queue classes.
- Solve problems: Valid Parentheses, Min Stack, Implement Queue using Stacks.
- Explore monotonic stacks and sliding window problems.

### 4. Trees
- Implement binary trees and binary search trees.
- Learn tree traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder.
- Solve Max Depth, Same Tree, Lowest Common Ancestor.

### 5. Graphs
- Understand graph representations (adjacency list/matrix).
- Implement DFS and BFS.
- Solve problems like Number of Islands, Clone Graph, Course Schedule.

### 6. Heaps and Priority Queues
- Implement min-heap and max-heap.
- Solve problems such as Kth Largest Element, Merge K Sorted Lists.

### 7. Hashmaps
- Practice key-value operations and hash set usage.
- Solve problems like Two Sum, Group Anagrams, Longest Substring Without Repeats.

### 8. Advanced Structures (Optional)
- Tries (Prefix Trees)
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
- Segment Trees and Binary Indexed Trees (Fenwick Trees)

## Best Practices

- Write clean, well-commented code.
- Test your solutions with multiple cases.
- Keep notes or update README files with insights.
- Use version control (Git) and commit regularly.
- Review and refactor your solutions.
- Participate in coding challenges and contests for real-world practice.
